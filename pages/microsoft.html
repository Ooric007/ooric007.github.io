          "The Chart Main Ribbon Tab is the centerpiece of the new Charting workflow in (Office 2011). Insert or change
          Chart type, edit your source data, and set quick layouts & styles to finish the look, in a left-to-right
          step-by-step sequence to bring data to life."<br />– Eric W., MacBU General Manager (current Head of
          Engineering at HP) giving Gold Star award comment
        </p>

        <p>
          "I worked with Eric for about four years in the Mac Business Unit at Microsoft. Eric turned out to be the best
          test engineer/SDET/QA ever throughout my 16 years of software development career. He is bright with high
          energy. Eric is detail-oriented and very systematic when testing software. Eric finds all kinds of bugs,
          regardless of their depth. He is also very good at automating tests. Eric is a customer/end-user advocate
          always thinking from a user's viewpoint, without whom I couldn't have delivered my features so very
          user-friendly and intuitive. Eric is also very cooperative and encouraging, very easy to work with as a team
          member. In fact, Eric and I were in a feature crew team for about a year. As a team, Eric and I worked closely
          together, bouncing and trying ideas, finishing series of features in top-notch quality in a really short
          period of time. I really hope to work with Eric again in the future. With Eric by the side, you will never
          worry about poor quality!"<br />– Cheeching (Henry) Y., SDE (current SDE II at Microsoft)
