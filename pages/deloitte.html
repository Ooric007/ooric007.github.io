        <p>
          At Deloitte/&Uuml;bermind Studios, I made significant contributions to numerous high-revenue projects for
          renowned
          companies. My work primarily involved testing responsive websites across 20+ devices, as well as testing
          popular iOS and Android mobile/TV apps. As a leader, I led bug bashes, oversaw QA processes, mentored peers,
          and conducted QA and ticket triage meetings. As a scrum master, I ensured efficient project management and
          fostered collaboration among the team. I continuously expanded my automation skills using C&#35;, JavaScript
          (Cypress), Python, Postman, and Ruby (Calabash) to automate various processes, significantly improving
          efficiency and quality. Additionally, I demonstrated versatility by creating chatbots, developing Figma
          prototypes, and completing salesforce.com admin training.

        My most recent role was a Test Lead on international Scrum teams for a top retail company where I played a
        pivotal role in the success of the project. I architected Azure test cases and implemented C&#35; automation
        using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/what-is-nuget" target="_blank">NuGet</a> and <a
          href="https://www.postman.com" target="_blank">Postman</a> for APIs, Selenium for Web UI, and Swift for Apple
        devices. Additionally, I contributed to the growth of the teams, fostering a culture of success through agile
        methodologies and cross-team collaboration.

        As the Test Lead for a responsive React website of a VR company, I played a crucial role in ensuring the quality
        and success of the project. The website introduced various new features including the Omniverse, custom <a

          booking</a>, <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank">MailChimp</a>, <a href="https://www.twilio.com/"

          href="https://ironcladapp.com/">Ironclad PactSafe</a>, and API service integrations, as well as SEO
        enhancements. In addition to my testing responsibilities, I took the lead in managing the copy effort by coding
        strings in multiple languages and collaborating closely with the client, copy editor, and the rest of the team.
        I also facilitated a daily triage call with the client, implemented Python and service automation to streamline
        processes, and developed an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-assistant/" target="_blank">IBM Watson
          chatbot</a> as a possible new feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        My longest project was testing the Showtime Anytime&#174; and Showtime&#174; apps for Android, Kindle Fire,
        Chromecast, Android TV, Fire Stick/TV, Tizen/WebOS TVs, iPhone, iPad, and Roku. Frequently used <a

        and <a href="../pages/roles.html#test-methods" target="_blank">session-based charter tests</a>, added automation, and led testing efforts while acting as a scrum master. Maintenance
        updates included Downloads, Live TV, analytics, device management, PPV, in-app purchasing, Android and iOS
        optimization.

          <q>I want it to be known, and will shout it from the uppermost rafters, that Eric Waldbaum
            has been a prominent leader on the project from Day 1. His level of ownership over the
            product, his attention to the most minute of detail, his rigor and standard, have made a
            HUGE impact on the quality of work we’ve delivered.
            I don’t often get a dedicated QA on my projects, but when I do, his name is the one I request. I
            remembered his work from HP back in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont,_Seattle"
              target="_blank">Fremont</a> days, and his work on The VOID is stellar.</q><br />– Brian E.,
